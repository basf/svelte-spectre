UI-kit based on [spectre.css](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/) and powered by SvelteJS. See the [documentation](https://kit.optimade.science), which is also a component explorer (storybook).

### Requirements

-   `node -v >= 15`
-   `npm -v >= 7`

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Building package

This builds the GUI components in a `package` folder:

```bash
npm run package
```

## Developing

This serves a [demonstration website](https://kit.optimade.science):

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

The demo website lives in a separate repo https://github.com/tilde-lab/svelte-spectre-storybook.

## Integration

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then run:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
